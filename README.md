# Automated Linear Regression with Streamlit

##  Goal
The goal of this project is to build an app using Streamlit that creates a linear regression model automatically from any data. It starts by testing the assumptions and significance, then saving the model in pickle format. For now, it only supports data in CSV and Excel formats with numerical independent variables. However, there might be updates in the near future. This app can be accessed [here](https://darren7753-automated-linear-regression-streamlit-app-i2szem.streamlit.app/).

## Tools
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data wrangling.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **SciPy** and **Statsmodels** for statistical analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn** for modeling.
- **Pickle** for saving the model.
- **Streamlit** for creating the app.
